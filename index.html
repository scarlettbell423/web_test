            <p>
                FUNDACIÓN CON CORA was a foundation created by Karol G with its main goal being to help vulnerable
                women everywhere. With the foundation's help, women who are in prison, homeless, hospitalized, 
                single mothers, and women who live in dangerous communities are all getting supported by Karol G's 
                team, led by her older sister Jessica.

                        <p>One of the many ways to help Con Cora is by donating atleast $1 USD (or whatever currency equivlent). 
                        Another way to help is to find volunteering opportunities, like submitting projects for collaboration.

        <h1>All about Karol G</h1>
        <section>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>Carolina Giraldo Navarro was born on February 14, 1991 in Medellín, Colombia and is the youngest of 3 sisters.
                Ever since she was little, she was always singing for family and friends, and her father was always her biggest 
                encouragement for music having been an aspiring musician himself. Karol throughout her adolescence and early adult hood 
                performed travelling from town to town in Colombia, and she veen performed on a Colombian spinoff version of the X-factor, 
                being eliminated early on. When she was 16 years old, she moved to Bogotá, Colombia's capital alone. Her then manager 
                sexually preyed on her in his home. Being so disillusioned by this, she moved to New York with her aunt to study English and
                business and quit music. However, after many month, she picked music up again and is now known as the international sensation we see 
                her as today.
